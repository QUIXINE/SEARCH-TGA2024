# SEARCH (TGA Project)
This project I made with friends to submit in THAILAND GAME TALENT SHOWCASE 2024 event. The project is submitted but the work is not at its peak, so right now it needs some fixing, for example the buggy situation, and the art. Even though the project is not selected, I gained more experience from this project. All of the mechanics I have to figure them out how to design and code all of them.

## Planning
This is how I design and plan the mechanics: [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/QRGgIMSMIwV9vnuIJdIyVQ/TGA-Project?node-id=104-2&t=k9SknOMCRxEknV3o-1)
